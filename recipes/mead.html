    <h2>Homemade Cyser Mead</h2>
    <p>Making mead at home is simple. All it takes is three basic ingredients: honey,
    water, and yeast. You can make mead more complex by adding different fruits, grains, herbs,
    and other flavorings. One special kind of mead is called <em>Cyser</em>, which
    is a mead that replaces water with apple juice.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds raw, unfiltered honey</li>
            <li>1 packet of Lalvin D47 yeast</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon yeast nutrient</li>
            <li>0.25 teaspoon yeast energizer</li>
            <li>Enough fresh pressed apple juice to make 1 gallon with all ingredients combined</li>
         </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Add honey to a clean 1 gallon glass carboy</li>
            <li>Pour in some apple juice until half the carboy is filled</li>
            <li>Put a lid on the carboy and shake until the honey is dissolved</li>
            <li>Add more apple juice until the carboy is almost filled, leaving several inches of headspace</li>
            <li>Add in the yeast nutrient, yeast energizer, and Lalvin D47 yeast</li>
            <li>Shake again to combine and put an airlock on the carboy</li>
            <li>Fermentation will start within a day and the airlock will bubble</li>
            <li>Once bubbling has finished, wait 1 week before bottling</li>
            <li>Drink right away or let age for however long you like. Either way, Enjoy!</li>
         </ol>
